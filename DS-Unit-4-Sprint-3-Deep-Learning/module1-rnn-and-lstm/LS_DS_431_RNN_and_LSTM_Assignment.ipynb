Let's see if we can get there a bit faster, with the power of Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM.\n",

    "Note - Shakespeare wrote an awful lot. It's OK, especially initially, to sample/use smaller data and parameters, so you can have a tighter feedback loop when you're trying to get things running. Then, once you've got a proof of concept - start pushing it more!"

    "- Make it more performant! Many possible routes here - lean on Keras, optimize the code, and/or use more resources (AWS, etc.)\n",
